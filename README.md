# 🤖 Jarvis - AI Chatbot API

Jarvis is the brain behind my [personal portfolio](https://rokesh28.github.io/) — an intelligent chatbot built using **OpenAI API** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to deliver smart, real-time responses to user queries.

Ask it anything — from my **skills**, **projects**, to even my **visa status** — and it'll reply contextually and accurately. Designed with a serverless architecture and deployed via **Vercel**, this chatbot API enables smooth, seamless interaction.
